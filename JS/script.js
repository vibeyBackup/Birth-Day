  `A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU FEEL SCARED
  <br/><br/>
  
  Fear is a natural and powerful emotion. It can make you feel vulnerable, exposed, and unsure of yourself. But I want you to know that feeling scared does not make you weak. It makes you human. It’s okay to feel fear, and it’s okay to seek comfort and support when you do.
  <br/><br/>

  Think about the times when you’ve been scared in the past and how you’ve overcome those fears. You have a remarkable ability to persevere, to find strength in the midst of uncertainty. Trust in that strength, and trust in yourself. You are capable of more than you know.
  <br/><br/>

  In moments of fear, take a deep breath and ground yourself in the present. Focus on your breathing, on the steady rhythm of your heart, and on the love that surrounds you. Fear often thrives on the unknown, but you have the power to bring yourself back to the present, to find calm in the midst of chaos.
  <br/><br/>

  When you feel scared, lean on me. Let me be your anchor, your source of stability. Share your fears with me, and let us face them together. You don’t have to go through this alone. Our bond is strong, and it can withstand any storm. I am here to support you, to offer comfort and reassurance, and to remind you of your inner strength.
  <br/><br/>

  Remember that fear is temporary. It will pass, and in its place, you will find clarity and peace. You have faced challenges before, and you have emerged stronger each time. This fear, too, shall pass, and you will come out the other side more resilient and wise. I understand and handle fear by using this quote from DUNE: 
  <br/><br/>

  "I must not fear.<br/>
  Fear is the mind-killer.<br/>
  Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.<br/>
  I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through me.<br/>
  And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.<br/> 
  Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. <br/>
  Only I will remain."<br/><br/>

  These words resonate deeply because they speak to the universal truth that fear, while natural and instinctual, has the power to paralyze us if left unchecked. It is the voice of doubt, the whisper of insecurity, the demon that haunts our dreams and threatens to harm our resilience.
  <br/><br/>
  But fear is not invincible. It is not an insurmountable force that can rule our destiny. It is merely a passing shadow, a fleeting emotion that ebbs and flows like the tide. And just as the tide recedes, so too can fear dissipate if we gather the courage to face it head-on.

  A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU FEEL ANGRY
  <br/><br/>
  Anger is a powerful emotion. It surges through us, demanding to be felt and acknowledged. It’s okay to feel angry. Your anger is valid, and it’s a sign that something important to you has been touched or threatened. But remember, you are not defined by your anger. You are a person of immense love, compassion, and depth.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel angry, allow yourself to express it in healthy ways. Scream into a pillow, punch a bag, go for a run—whatever you need to do to release that pent-up energy. Your anger deserves an outlet, and it’s better to let it out than to let it fester inside you. Know that you can always talk to me about what’s bothering you. I am here to listen, without judgment, to understand your perspective and to help you find a way through.
  <br/><br/>
  I want you to know that your anger does not scare me. It’s a part of you, and I accept all of you—the good, the bad, and the in-between. Your passion and intensity are part of what makes you so special. They show that you care deeply, that you’re invested in the world around you. Your emotions are a testament to your vibrant spirit.
  <br/><br/>
  In those moments of anger, try to find a quiet place within yourself. Breathe deeply, in and out, and allow the anger to flow through you and then away from you. It’s not about suppressing your feelings, but about letting them pass so they don’t consume you. Remember the times when you felt nothing but joy and love. Let those memories remind you that tranquility is within reach.
  <br/><br/>
  Anger can be a catalyst for change. It can push you to address issues that need attention, to stand up for yourself, to demand better. But it’s important to channel it constructively. Think about what’s causing your anger and how you can address it in a way that brings about positive change. You have a powerful voice, and your thoughts and feelings matter.
  <br/><br/>
  When you’re ready, talk to me about what’s going on. Share your frustrations, your fears, your concerns. Let’s work through them together. We are a team, and together, we can face anything. I am here to support you, to stand by your side, and to help you find solutions. You don’t have to carry this burden alone.
  <br/><br/>
  Remember that anger, like all emotions, is temporary. It will pass, and in its place, we can find understanding and resolution. You have the strength and the wisdom to navigate through this. Trust yourself, and trust in us.
  <br/><br/>
  You are loved, even in your angriest moments. Your worth is not diminished by your anger. You are a beautiful, complex person, and I am grateful for every facet of who you are. Together, we can turn this anger into a force for good, into something that strengthens us and our relationship.

  A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU CRAVE LOVE
  <br/><br/>
  There are times when the world feels cold and distant, and all you crave is the warmth of love and connection. In those moments, I want you to know how deeply you are loved. You are my heart, my soul, and my everything. My love for you is unwavering and eternal.
  (edit: not gf-bf love… what remains is pure)
  <br/><br/>
  When you want love, reach out to me. Let me wrap you in my cheesy lines, make you cringe, and remind you of how cherished you are. Let these moments be a balm for your soul, a reminder that you are never alone.
  <br/><br/>
  Our love is a beautiful journey, filled with countless moments of joy, laughter, and tenderness. Remember the times we’ve shared—the ups and downs, the fights and patch ups, making fun of each other but providing a shoulder to cry on, being completely different yet understanding each other's needs etc.
  <br/><br/>
  When you want love, think of all the ways we’ve shown our affection for each other. The small gestures, like eye squinch or a kind word, and the grand declarations, like promises made and cards/letters. Our love is woven into the fabric of our lives, a constant presence that brings comfort and joy.
  <br/><br/>
  You are deserving of all the love in the world. Your heart is pure, your spirit is kind, and your soul is beautiful. My love for you is a reflection of the incredible person you are. You have a light within you that shines brightly, illuminating the lives of everyone you touch.
  <br/><br/>
  In moments when you crave love, know that I am here for you. I am here to listen, to support, to cherish, and to adore you. You are my priority. Your happiness and well-being mean everything to me, and I will do whatever it takes to ensure you feel loved and valued.
  Some thank-yous are due so here we go:
  <br/><br/>
  1. Thank You for Being You : <br/>
  From the second I met you, I knew that there was something different about you. You weren’t like everyone else; you were different. Well, that is because you are simply you, and there is no one quite like you. You are the smartest, funniest, and kindest person I have ever met. You inspire me every day to be the best person I can be by simply setting a great example. So let me start by thanking you for just being you.
  <br/><br/>
  2. Thank You for Letting Me Be Myself : <br/>
  You always let me be my crazy, silly, funny, weird self. You never make me feel uncomfortable about being myself; you actually encourage me to be myself. Your acceptance means the world to me. Thank you for letting me be me.
  <br/><br/>
  3. Thank You for Being Silly : <br/>
  Sometimes the things that you come up with or the stuff that comes out of your mouth is so silly that I can't help but laugh hysterically at you. You’re basically a 5-year-old in an adult body, well, sometimes. But you also know how to be professional and mature at the same time. Your silliness brings so much joy into my life. Thank you for being fun.
  <br/><br/>
  4. Thank You for Being So Easygoing : <br/>
  You always let me choose where to go to dinner or what we want to eat, and that's the best because, well... food is the best of all, besides you of course. But besides food, whenever I’m bored, you always agree with my silly, spontaneous ideas and are down for any adventure. Thank you for being my partner in crime. You rock.
  <br/><br/>
  5. Thank You for Helping Me : <br/>
  Especially with understanding my feelings and emotions. I am a very emotional  person, I easily get dazed and consumed by the emotions I am feeling. You always make me feel that my emotions are valid and you shouldn’t be ashamed of feeling the way you feel. Thank you for being my practical person.
  <br/><br/>
  6. Thank You for Letting Me Vent to You : <br/>
  Whenever something is bothering me, you know before I even know, and you know exactly how to handle it. You always have the right things to say exactly when I need to hear them. You always know how to make me feel better, and I love you for that. Thank you for being my shoulder to cry on.
  <br/><br/>
  7. Thank You for Putting Me in My Place When I Need It : <br/>
  When I tell you about something that happened, you're not afraid to tell me I’m wrong. And sometimes I definitely need to hear that. You wouldn't be helping me if you just constantly sided with me and told me I am right even when I’m not. You truly make me a better me. So, thank you.
  <br/><br/>
  8. Thank You for Dreaming with Me : <br/>
  We have so many plans for the future, and I cannot wait to achieve our dreams together! I am so excited for our plans! I also have no doubt in my mind that we won't be able to achieve these dreams. I cannot wait for our future selves.
  <br/><br/>
  9. Thank You for Being My Best Friend : <br/>
  You’re there for me. You are always there for me. When I’m upset, you’re the first person I think of to call. When something amazing or happy happens to me, you’re the first person I tell it to. When something bad happens, you’re the first person to offer a shoulder to cry on..
  <br/><br/>
  10. Thank You for Understanding Me : <br/>
  You understand me better than I understand myself. You know what’s right for me even before I know what I should do about it. You know what I’m going to think and spiral about before I even start spiraling down. It sounds silly, but that’s just an example. And the worst part is you always end up being right, which is very hard to admit. Thank you for always guiding me in the right direction and having patience with me.
  <br/><br/>
  11. Thank You for Making Me Feel Beautiful : <br/>
  Even when I look horrible, or when I’m sick, you still make me feel beautiful. I mean, I know I definitely don’t look great while being sick, especially in headaches, but you tell me I am anyways. You always make me feel like a king no matter what. Thank you for making me love myself.
  <br/><br/>
  12. Thank You for Loving Me : <br/>
  You do so much for me… clearly, but this has to be the one that I am most grateful for. You love me endlessly no matter what. You have taken the time to get to know my family, my whole life, basically everything about me. The best part is that you love everything about me. So thank you for showing me what true love is.

  A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU FEEL ALONE
  <br/><br/>
  There will be times when distance separates us, and the loneliness feels overwhelming. In those moments, I want you to remember that you are never truly alone. My love for you knows no bounds, and it transcends any physical distance that might come between us.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel alone or miss me, close your eyes and think of all the moments we’ve shared. Remember the times we’ve laughed together until our sides ached, the long ended calls, the long strings of text. These memories are proof of the deep bond we share, a bond that cannot be broken by distance.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel alone, remember that I am always here for you. Reach out to me, whether through a call, a message, or simply a thought. Let me know how you’re feeling, and let us find comfort in each other’s presence, even from afar. 
  <br/><br/>
  You have always been there for me, through my highs and lows, with unwavering support and love. You have this incredible ability to see through my masks, to understand the words I can't say, and to offer a shoulder to lean on when I need it most. Your kindness, empathy, and genuine care have shaped me in more ways than I can express. For that, and for so much more, I am eternally grateful.
  <br/><br/>
  In those moments when you feel lonely or overwhelmed, know that I am just a call away. But even if we can't speak right away, close your eyes and imagine my arms wrapped around you, giving you the biggest hug, the kind that says, "I've got you, no matter what." Picture us sitting together, sharing our thoughts, our dreams, and our laughter. Feel my presence and know that you are never alone.
  In the quiet moments, when the loneliness feels too much to bear, know that I am thinking of you. I miss you too, more than words can express. It is a reminder of how much you mean to me and how precious our time together is.
  <br/><br/>
  We will be reunited soon, and until then, hold onto the love we share. Let it bring you comfort and strength. You are never alone. My heart is always with you, no matter where we are. Together, we can endure any distance, and our love will only grow stronger with time.
  <br/><br/>
  I could write on and on about how we can be there for each other when we feel alone but I also want to give you another view too. I want you to also learn to enjoy the company of the most important person yourself. 
  <br/><br/>
  This world is not easy - living is not easy. It has never been and it will never be. No one will come to you and say "I got this, I'll solve your problems." You have to do it yourself. Use the time you have on this planet sensibly, don't waste it. Make experiences, memories, and mistakes. Fall seven times, stand up eight. And if you get to a point where you feel your life is going in the wrong direction, stop. Take a deep breath in. Put your hair up in a bun, drink some coffee, and handle it. Your best teacher is your last mistake, and remember that storms don't last forever. You have the power to change your life, make a difference, reinvent yourself, improve yourself. 365 new days, 365 new chances.
  <br/><br/>
  All that matters is that you are happy because happy girls are the prettiest. Travel as much as you can, fall in love, be humble, and don't take the happy moments for granted. Do more of what makes you happy, be brave, believe in yourself. You only have this one life. Do what feels good, do more of it. Don't stop until you're satisfied and you feel you've done your best. Take risks. You have this one life, it's your life, don't waste it. Make yourself proud and start now. Don't worry about tomorrow and let the past behind you. Live in the moment.

  ` A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU FEEL SAD
  <br/><br/>
  
  There are moments in life when sadness feels like the heavy fog of a cold morning, blocking the joy and light that usually guide our days. In these moments, it’s important to remember that it’s okay to feel sad. Sadness is a natural emotion that reminds us of our humanity and our capacity to feel deeply.
  <br/><br/>

  When you feel sad, I want you to take a time-out to breathe and allow yourself to fully experience your emotions. It’s okay to cry, to let the tears flow freely. Crying is not a sign of weakness, but a release of the pain you hold inside. I know you like being quiet and all by yourself. Use those moments of quiet to rest, heal, rejuvenate and to do some much needed pampering sessions.
  <br/><br/>

  You are stronger than you know. Every challenge you’ve faced, every hurdle you’ve overcome, has made you the resilient person you are today. Your strength lies not just in your ability to endure, but in your capacity to feel deeply and to keep moving forward, no matter how heavy your heart feels.
  <br/><br/>

  In your sadness, lean on me. Let me be your rock, your favorite therapist. I am here to listen, to hold you, to comfort you in whatever way you need. Together, we can face the darkest of days and find our way back to the light. You are never alone in this journey.
  <br/><br/>

  Remember to take care of yourself. Surround yourself with things that bring you comfort and peace. Listen to your favorite music, immerse yourself in a good drama, take a walk in nature, or simply rest. Allow yourself the time and space to heal. Your well-being is so important to me, and I want nothing more than to see you smile again.
  <br/><br/>

  You have a light within you, even when you can’t see it. It’s the light that brightens my days and warms my heart. Hold onto that light, and know that it will guide you through the darkness. I believe in you, and I believe in our bond. Together, we can overcome anything.
  <br/><br/>

  Lean on our shared strength and the bond we’ve built. Know that I am here, always, ready to support you, to lift you up, and to remind you of your incredible worth. You are loved beyond measure, and nothing can change that.

  A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU FEEL DOWN
  <br/><br/>
  There are days when life feels heavy, and your spirit is low. On those days, it’s important to remember that it’s okay to feel down. It’s a natural part of life, and it’s okay to give yourself permission to rest and heal. You don’t have to be strong all the time.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel down, take a moment to acknowledge your feelings. It’s okay to feel sad, to feel tired, to feel like the world is weighing you down. These feelings are valid, and they deserve to be acknowledged. Allow yourself to feel them, without judgment or guilt.
  <br/><br/>
  Think about the times when you’ve felt this way before, and how you’ve always found a way to rise again. You have a remarkable resilience, a strength that carries you through even the darkest of days. Trust in that strength, and trust that you will find your way through this, too.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel down, surround yourself with things that bring you comfort and peace. Listen to your favorite music, watch a movie that makes you laugh, cuddle up with a warm blanket, or take a walk in nature. These small acts of self-care can make a big difference in lifting your spirits.
  <br/><br/>
  I know people are trying to reach out to you to tell you that everything is going to be alright and that they’re there for you. Please – and I can’t stress this enough – don’t push them away or shut them out. You may not want to hear it, but those people are there for you and would do anything to help you.
  So, give them a chance even when you don’t think they’ll understand your pain. You’ll never know if you don’t let them in. You’re feeling alone right now. So alone that you don’t think anyone can see the pain you’re going through.
  <br/><br/>
  I want you to know I see you, okay? I can see the pain written all over your face because I know the look of someone trying so hard to pretend like they’re alright when they’re crumbling on the inside. You’re not alone, you have people in your life, and even people you didn’t see coming, who are more than willing to reach out and be there for you.
  <br/><br/>
  I know you feel like you can’t get through this. I know it seems like your world is coming down on you and you can’t find the strength to get back up. You’re spending your days crying in your room, in the shower, while doing laundry, and you can’t eat, sleep or find the ambition to go outside and breathe in the fresh air.
  <br/><br/>
  Reach out to me. Let me be there for you, to offer a listening ear, a comforting hug, or simply a quiet presence. You don’t have to go through this alone. Our love is a source of strength and comfort, and I am here to support you in any way you need.
  <br/><br/>
  Remember the times we’ve shared, the moments of joy and laughter, the adventures and the never-ending banter. These memories are a testament to the happiness and love that we’ve built together. Even when the present feels heavy, the past is filled with proof that better days have existed and will come again.
  <br/><br/>
  Take a moment to breathe deeply, to ground yourself in the present. Focus on the love that surrounds you, the people who care about you, and the beauty that exists in the world. Even in the darkest of times, there is light to be found. You are capable of finding that light, and of bringing it into your life.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel down, remind yourself of your worth. You are an incredible person, with so much to offer the world. Your kindness, your strength, your intelligence, and your love are just a few of the qualities that make you special. You are valued and cherished, not just by me, but by everyone who knows you.
  <br/><br/>
  You are not defined by your low moments. You are defined by the way you rise from them, the way you continue to move forward, even when it feels difficult. Your resilience is a testament to your character, and it is something to be proud of.

  A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU FEEL LEFT BEHIND
  <br/><br/>
  Feeling left behind can be one of the most isolating and painful experiences. It’s as if the world is moving forward, leaving you in a place of stagnation and uncertainty. I want you to know that you are never truly left behind. Your journey is unique and valuable, and it unfolds at its own pace.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel left behind, remember that everyone’s path is different. Comparing your journey to others’ can lead to unnecessary pain and self-doubt. You have your own timeline, your own story, and it is unfolding exactly as it should. Your experiences, challenges, and triumphs are all part of what makes you uniquely you.
  <br/><br/>
  Think about the accomplishments you’ve achieved, the obstacles you’ve overcome, and the growth you’ve experienced. These milestones, no matter how small they may seem, are significant. They are proof of your resilience, your strength, and your determination. You are not stagnant; you are evolving, growing, and becoming the person you are meant to be.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel left behind, allow yourself to feel the emotions that come with it. It’s okay to feel sad, frustrated, or even angry. These feelings are valid and deserve to be acknowledged. But don’t let them define you. You are so much more than a momentary feeling of inadequacy or stagnation.
  <br/><br/>
  Reach out to me!! Let’s talk about your feelings, your fears, and your dreams. Let’s remind each other of the beauty of our individual journeys and the strength we find in our partnership. I am here to support you, to lift you up, and to remind you of your incredible worth. You are not alone in this; we are in it together.
  <br/><br/>
  Remember the times when you’ve felt unsure or left behind in the past, and how you’ve always found a way forward. You are resourceful and capable, and you have a remarkable ability to adapt and grow. Trust in yourself and your journey. Trust that you are exactly where you need to be right now, and that better days are ahead.
  <br/><br/>
  You have so much to offer this world, and your path is filled with potential and promise. Embrace the journey, even when it feels uncertain. Your experiences, both good and bad, are shaping you into a person of depth and wisdom. You are not left behind; you are simply on a different path, one that is uniquely yours.
  <br/><br/>
  Take a moment to reflect on the people who love and support you. You are surrounded by those who believe in you, who see your potential, and who are cheering you on every step of the way. Their faith in you is a testament to your worth and your abilities.
  <br/><br/>
  You are never truly left behind. Your journey is important, and it is leading you to a beautiful destination. Trust in the process, and know that you are exactly where you need to be.
  <br/><br/>
  I believe in you, and I am here for you, always. Together, we can face any challenge, overcome any obstacle, and find our way forward. You are loved, cherished, and valued beyond measure. Never forget how special you are, and how much you mean to me. Your journey is a beautiful one, and I am honored to be a part of it.
  <br/><br/>
  Moving abroad is a huge step for me, and while I am excited about the new opportunities and adventures that await, I can't help but feel a pang of sadness knowing that we won't be physically together as often. But above all, I want you to know that my love and admiration for you transcend any distance.
  I know you’ve been feeling like you’re missing out or falling behind because you chose to stay in India while I embark on this new journey. Please, let me assure you that your path is no less valuable or significant than mine. Life isn’t a race; it’s a series of beautiful, unique journeys that we each must travel in our own way and at our own pace.
  <br/><br/>
  You’ve chosen to stay in India, and in doing so, you’ve embraced a path filled with its own remarkable experiences, growth, and opportunities. You are not missing out, my dear friend; you are carving your own unique story, one that is just as rich and meaningful as any adventure abroad. The world has a way of making us feel like we need to constantly be on the move to find success or fulfillment, but true contentment comes from following your heart and staying true to yourself.

  "The Road Less Travelled"<br/>
  Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
  And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
  And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
  And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
  To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br/>
  <br/>
  Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
  And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
  Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
  Though as for that the passing there<br/>
  Had worn them really about the same,<br/>
  <br/>
  And both that morning equally lay<br/>
  In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
  Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
  Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
  I doubted if I should ever come back.<br/>
  <br/>
  I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
  Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
  Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—<br/>
  I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
  And that has made all the difference.<br/>

  A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU FEEL LIKE GIVING UP
  <br/><br/>
  When life feels overwhelming and the urge to give up takes hold, remember this: you are stronger than you think. You've faced challenges before and emerged victorious. Your resilience is remarkable.
  <br/><br/>
  Take a deep breath. Ground yourself in the present. Acknowledge your feelings—they are valid—but know they do not define you. You are capable of overcoming anything.
  <br/><br/>
  Reflect on past moments of struggle. Recall how you’ve always managed to keep going. Trust in your strength and determination. You have the power to navigate through this, just as you have done before.
  <br/><br/>
  When you feel like giving up, reach out to me. Let me be your support, your listener, your comforter. You don’t have to face this alone. Our love is a source of strength, and together, we can overcome any challenge.
  <br/><br/>
  Remember your dreams and goals. They are worth fighting for, and so are you. Every small step you take brings you closer to achieving them. Reflect on your accomplishments, no matter how minor they may seem. Each one is proof of your strength and perseverance.
  <br/><br/>
  Think of the people who love and support you. You are not alone in this journey. You have a network cheering you on, believing in you, and seeing your potential. Let their love bolster you.
  <br/><br/>

  "The Journey"
  <br/>
  One day you finally knew<br/>
  what you had to do, and began,<br/>
  though the voices around you<br/>
  kept shouting<br/>
  their bad advice –<br/>
  though the whole house<br/>
  began to tremble<br/>
  and you felt the old tug<br/>
  at your ankles.<br/>
  "Mend my life!"<br/>
  each voice cried.<br/>
  But you didn't stop.<br/>
  You knew what you had to do,<br/>
  though the wind pried<br/>
  with its stiff fingers<br/>
  at the very foundations,<br/>
  though their melancholy<br/>
  was terrible.<br/>
  It was already late<br/>
  enough, and a wild night,<br/>
  and the road full of fallen<br/>
  branches and stones.<br/>
  But little by little,<br/>
  as you left their voices behind,<br/>
  the stars began to burn<br/>
  through the sheets of clouds,<br/>
  and there was a new voice<br/>
  which you slowly<br/>
  recognized as your own,<br/>
  that kept you company<br/>
  as you strode deeper and deeper<br/>
  into the world,<br/>
  determined to do<br/>
  the only thing you could do –<br/>
  determined to save<br/>
  the only life you could save.<br/><br/>

  I know things are tough right now, and giving up might seem like the easiest option. But I want to remind you of something important: you are incredibly strong. You've faced challenges before and you've always found a way through them.
  <br/><br/>
  You have dreams and goals that are worth fighting for, and so are you. Reflect on your accomplishments, no matter how small they seem. Each one is a testament to your strength and resilience.

  A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU NEED TO LET GO
  <br/><br/>
  I hope you learn how to let go.
  <br/><br/>
  I hope you learn how to let go of everyone's opinion of your life. I hope you start to see, from a place that lives deep within you, that there is no universally correct way to live a life that is solely your own. Every human being has different goals, has different concepts of what happiness looks like, has a different vision of what it truly means to be alive. And because of that, people will judge you, the world will try to change you, but you must continue to move in your own direction, you must continue to go at your own pace, because if you allow for that to alter your path - you're going to end up living someone else's life. I hope you learn how to make your life your own. I hope you learn how to make your time here something you are proud of.
  <br/><br/>
  I hope you learn how to let go of the comparison you hold so closely to your chest. I hope you strive to dismantle the distractions, I hope you strive to see beyond what is manicured and what is filtered in this life. You are a real human being who is living and breathing in this world, who is healing through and moving through seasons of beauty and seasons of change and seasons of evolution each and every single day. Your experience in this world will never be perfect, will never be faultless - but it will be real. It will be honest. I hope you learn how to embrace that.
  <br/><br/>
  I hope you learn how to let go of your tendency to favor distance over depth. I hope you learn how to open to this world, how to let love pour into your life. We often protect ourselves from seeming too eager or too interested; we hold our feelings back because we don't want to seem overly emotional or tender. We silence our instincts, we bankrupt our souls, and at the end of the day, we feel alone. I hope you learn how to let go of your fear, I hope you learn how to remind yourself that there is nothing wrong with vulnerability, with being human, with unhinging your rib cage and sharing your heart with this world. There is beauty to be found in being the person who cares. So care.
  <br/><br/>
  In the midst of chaos, amidst the noise of the world's opinions and the clamor of comparison, remember to listen to the quiet whispers of your own heart. It holds the truth of who you are, the essence of your being, and the guiding light to your most authentic self. Embrace the journey of letting go, for in releasing the burdens of external expectations, you'll find the freedom to dance to the rhythm of your own soul.

  A LETTER FOR WHEN YOU NEED APPLOUD
  <br/><br/>
  If no one told you this today - I am proud of who you are becoming.<br/><br/>
  Sometimes, we need others to speak what they see in us because we don't truly see it within ourselves. We don't see our own potential. We see our pasts, we see our wounds, we see all of the stories and the narratives life has placed inside of our minds. We see our anxiety, or our overthinking, or the way we care so deeply as if it were a weakness within us. We see all of the things we have yet to do, all of the things around us that others have and we don't. We compare ourselves, we aren't gentle with ourselves or our journey or the way we are fighting to become the kind of human being that we ourselves are proud of.<br/><br/>
  Sometimes, we need to be reminded that we are deserving of everything we desire from life. That nothing in our past makes us unworthy of our future. That there is beauty in working towards healing, and growing, and becoming the kind of person who adds light and hope into this world, in even the smallest of ways. I see how hard you are trying. And I want you to know that I am proud of you for that. To want to be a better person is such an intensely beautiful thing. To want to be better in this world, to want to love more, care more, do more with your time here - that is special. And you deserve to believe in the goodness that is waiting for you on the other side of your healing. You deserve to believe that there is beauty out there for you, that the things that are meant to find you, and stay, are going to come into your life; that you are going to be in awe of your life, that you are going to discover your own version of happiness. So this is your reminder.<br/><br/>
  Who you are in this very moment is valid, and worthy. The way you want to love and be loved, is valid. The dreams you have are valid. The goals you have are valid. Your healing is valid. Your sadness, and your grief, is valid. Your happiness is valid. You have so much potential within you. You are capable of so much. And I am sorry that the world, at times, has tried to convince you otherwise. But you are going to be okay, you are going to become the human being you have always hoped to be. You are going to look back on the moments you ever doubted your becoming, and you are going to be so glad that you kept going. So keep going. You are growing and evolving more beautifully than you may realize right now. Please don't lose sight of that.<br/><br/>
  My dear friend, as you navigate through life's ups and downs, remember that you are not alone. I am here, cheering you on every step of the way. Your journey is unique, and every obstacle you overcome is a testament to your strength and resilience. You are a shining beacon of hope and inspiration, and I am honored to witness your growth. Keep shining, keep believing in yourself, and never forget how truly remarkable you are.

  A LETTER WITH LIST OF THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU
  <br/><br/>
  My love, "hate" is a strong word, and in truth, there is nothing about you that I truly hate. There may be things that frustrate or challenge me, but they are part of what makes you who you are. Even these aspects, I love and accept, because they are a part of the beautiful, complex person I fell in love with. However, in the spirit of honesty and transparency, here are some things that sometimes make me pause:

  I'M SORRY THESE REASONS MAY OR MAY NOT BE THE THINGS I LOVE ABOUT YOU...  <br/><br/>
  I hate the way you're always so considerate and selfless, putting my needs before your own without a second thought. It frustrates me how you never prioritize your own well-being, always ensuring that I'm comfortable and happy even at the expense of your own happiness. But at the same time, I can't help but admire your unwavering kindness and generosity. Your willingness to sacrifice for the ones you love is a testament to the depth of your character and the purity of your heart. It's one of the many qualities that make you so beautiful, even when it drives me crazy.<br/><br/>
  I hate how you're always so forgiving, never holding grudges or dwelling on past mistakes. Your ability to let go of resentment and embrace forgiveness is both infuriating and awe-inspiring. Sometimes I wish you would stand up for yourself more and demand the respect you deserve. But then I remember that your capacity for forgiveness is what makes you so special. It's a reflection of your compassion and empathy, qualities that I deeply admire and strive to emulate in my own life.<br/><br/>
  I hate how you're so patient and understanding, even when I'm being difficult or unreasonable. Your calm demeanor and gentle nature can be infuriating when I'm feeling frustrated or upset. It's as if nothing can shake your inner peace or ruffle your feathers, no matter how chaotic the situation may be. But then I realize that your patience is one of your greatest strengths. It allows you to navigate life's challenges with grace and dignity, inspiring those around you to approach adversity with a sense of calm and resilience.<br/><br/>
  I hate how you're always so modest and humble, never seeking recognition or praise for your accomplishments. Your humility can be frustrating at times, especially when I want to celebrate your achievements and sing your praises from the rooftops. But then I remember that your humility is what makes you so endearing. It keeps you grounded and down-to-earth, reminding me that true beauty lies not in outward appearances or material possessions, but in the depth of one's character and the kindness of one's heart.<br/><br/>
  I hate how you're always so positive and optimistic, even in the face of adversity or disappointment. Your relentless optimism can be maddening when I'm feeling cynical or pessimistic about the world. It's as if you refuse to acknowledge the darker aspects of life, choosing instead to focus on the silver linings and the brighter side of things. But then I realize that your positivity is infectious. It lifts my spirits and reminds me that there is always hope, even in the darkest of times. It's a reminder to approach life with gratitude and optimism, even when the world seems bleak.<br/><br/>
  So yes, there are things about you that drive me crazy and push my buttons. But in the end, I wouldn't change a single thing about you. Because even the qualities that I hate are a part of what makes you so special and so beautiful. They add depth and complexity to your character, enriching our relationship and making me love you even more fiercely than before.
